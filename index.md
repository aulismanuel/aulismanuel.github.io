## Introduction

Hi, I'm Aulis. I study linguistic, both traditional and computational, in the University of Helsinki, and work as cabin crew. Yeah, it's tricky to study and work at the same time, both full time. On my freetime I enjoy going to orchestral concerts with my friends. And here in Bergen (where I'm based now) I love to walk on the steep cobblestone alleys with tiny stairs up and down, listening to music and enjoying the views.
